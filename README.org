#+title: Raycast Actions

* [[file:flickr-snippet.sh][Make a flickr snippet]]

Works with Safari and Chrome. Invoke it, select an output format, enter some alt text, get a snippet back to your clipboard.

Output formats are =md=, =org=, or =html=

Output looks like this:

#+begin_src
![Mutoid Man performs in Portland, OR](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54510124850_12cef1aed1_b.jpg)
#+end_src

This is built to work with a custom link type in org-mode:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-add-link-type
 "img" nil
 (lambda (path desc backend)
   (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'md)
     (format "![%s](%s)" desc path))))
#+end_src

If you don't want to use the =img:= link, remove =img:= on line 54
